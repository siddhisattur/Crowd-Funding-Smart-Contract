# Crowd-Funding-Smart-Contract

● The Admin will start a campaign for CrowdFunding with a specific monetary goal and
deadline.
● Contributors will contribute to that project by sending ETH.
● The admin has to create a Spending Request to spend money for the campaign.
● Once the spending request was created, the Contributors can start voting for that
specific Spending Request.
● If more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request, then the admin would
have the permission to spend the amount specified in the spending request.
● The power is moved from the campaign’s admin to those that donated money.
● The contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the
deadline.
